Welcome to Potential Contrasting!
=================================================

Potential contrasting can learn a potential energy function using an ensemble 
of molecular conformations such that the learned potential energy can reproduce
the conformational distribution. An example use of potential contrasting is to 
learn coarse-grained force fields using molecular conformations generated
by all-atom simulations.
